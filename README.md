# Dog vs Cat Image Classification using CNN

This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. It uses TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib for preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Dog and Cat Classification Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dog-and-cat-classification-dataset)
- **Structure**:
```
dog_cat_data/
├── Training/
│ ├── Dog/
│ └── Cat/
└── Testing/
├── Dog/
└── Cat/
```

---

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (recommended)

---

##  Project Pipeline

###  1. Data Preprocessing
- Read image files using `cv2`.
- Resize and normalize pixel values.
- Encode labels (0: Cat, 1: Dog).
- Split into training and testing sets.

---

## Accuracy
- Above 90% on validation data
